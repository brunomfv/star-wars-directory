# Star Wars Character Directory

This is a very simple React app that lists Star Wars characters.

## Tooling

The implementation was done in [React](https://react.dev/) with Typescript, [styled components](https://styled-components.com/) for UI components, and [Vite](https://vite.dev/) to build it all. Tests were created using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/).
